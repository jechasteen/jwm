 *
 * dynamic window manager is designed like any other X client as well. It is
 * driven through handling X events. In contrast to other X clients, a window
 * manager selects for SubstructureRedirectMask on the root window, to receive
 * events about window (dis-)appearance. Only one X connection at a time is
 * allowed to select for this event mask.
 *
 * The event handlers of dwm are organized in an array which is accessed
 * whenever a new event has been fetched. This allows event dispatching
 * in O(1) time.
 *
 * Each child of the root window is called a client, except windows which have
 * set the override_redirect flag. Clients are organized in a linked client
 * list on each monitor, the focus history is remembered through a stack list
 * on each monitor. Each client contains a bit array to indicate the tags of a
 * client.
 *
 * Keys and tagging rules are organized as arrays and defined in config.h.
 *
 * To understand everything else, start reading main().
